The Rise of AI Chatbots: Disrupting Industries and Transforming Customer Expeience

Definition and Description

Disruptive technologies are innovations that disrupt established markets by starting in a niche and overtaking the competition. Personal computers and cell phones are disruptive technologies that cause significant changes in people's lives. They have revolutionized our study, work, and free time. The demand for computers and cell phones reduced the use of typewriters and telephones and brought significant changes to the market.

Clayton Christensen, a business consultant and Harvard Business School professor, first introduced the term disrupted technology as "disruptive innovation" in a 1995 article in Harvard Business Review. Disruptive innovation, coined by Christensen, is a technology that suddenly alters how industries, companies, and consumers operate. It resembles the Fourth Industrial Revolution, characterized by digitalization and emerging technological advances, according to Repsol.com.

One example of disruptive technology currently making waves in the market is Artificial Intelligence (AI) Chatbots. It's an automated software that converses with users automatically and offers 24/7 customer service.

Davenport et al. (2021) state that AI can significantly enhance marketing by improving customer understanding, product matching, and persuasion. Numerous companies have started utilizing artificial AI to manage specific tasks, such as programmatic buying for digital ad placement. It also assists in broad functions like improving the accuracy of sales forecasts and enhances human efforts in structured tasks like customer service.

According to Samarth, V. (2023), AI-powered chatbots can enhance digital marketing campaigns by providing personalized customer support, collecting and analyzing lead generation data, and improving customer engagement and satisfaction. AI-powered chatbots    can prove to be beneficial for digital marketing campaigns in the following ways:
